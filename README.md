# Epileptic_Seizure_detection
Epilepsy is a common brain disorder characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures which
according to the World Health Organization (WHO) affects over 65 million people worldwide. Yet, a more
relevant statistic is that 70% of people affected by this disorder live in low-income, third-world countries
and are either misdiagnosed or do not have access to the right treatment. Electroencephalography (EEG) has
been commonly used for diagnosis through visual inspection of the recorded EEG signals. However, this task
is considerably time consuming and requires neurologistsâ€™ expertise. Therefore, accurate computer-aided
automatic epileptic seizure diagnosis approaches are urgently needed in clinical routine. However, recent
computed-aided approaches fail to capture seizures with satisfactory rates, leading to inefficient detection
performance. In this paper, we propose a new framework which focuses on autonomous feature engineering.
The proposed approach combines two types of features: the recently developed semi-classical signal
processing features and the conventional nonlinear dynamical features which rely mainly on information
entropy theory. Autonomous optimization of the time-embedding hyper-parameters of the latter features
is proposed and features ranking and selection using ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) is performed. In
addition, a two dimensional Generative Adversarial Networks (2D-GAN) is proposed to restore balance in
the inherently unbalanced EEG dataset. Finally, the selected features are fed into five different classifiers
and tested on the Bonn University database to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology.
The experimental results show that all five classifiers yield a performance accuracy of that spans from 93%
to 100%, and a sensitivity and specificity that spans in the same interval. The proposed method shows great
potential for real-time diagnosis of the epileptic seizure and a contribution to characterization of epileptic
EEG signals
